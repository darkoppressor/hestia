This is the source code for a game currently being developed by Cheese and Bacon Games.

Hestia is a multiplayer real-time strategy game. It began life a few years ago as an idea and a partially implemented game.
However, its design grew too large and complicated, and the project was eventually abandoned.
The idea was resurrected for a university senior project, and an initial version that includes most of the basic original features has been developed.
Players in the game control one civilization, which consists of a number of cities, each of which have a number of people living in them.
Players give high-level strategic orders, and the people in their civilization then make these strategic decisions a reality using low-level individual AI.
Because of this somewhat unique in-game perspective, the game takes some ideas from turn-based strategy games.
