# Victory conditions

The game has victory conditions (well, one for now)
If all VCs are off, the game has no end
Conquest victory condition: Be the only civilization left undefeated

Have domination, and time VCs
Need a game option for ending year
Each leader needs a score

I'd really like to rethink victory conditions. So many games feel too forced and gamey
Players should be able to pick their large scale goals, and maybe victory should be open ended?

Victory conditions... I dunno. They help make games end but what if you don't want it to? That should also be catered to in a large scale grand strategy game like this
Rather than have victory conditions, what if I just made it more interesting after a player has "won" in some way. For most victory condition ideas, I can just not have it end the game. You are super rich? Cool, carry on and do other stuff or end the game of your own choice
For conquering everyone, what if keeping large empires together becomes basically impossible, and eventually there are rebellions and new civilizations form

Maybe just conquest victory, but there are tons of options to achieve that
Trade and diplomacy etc, but also cool stuff like zombie armies
