Add controls (sliders, buttons, idk) for surplus percentages
The current constants for these will become the default values

Add pause network command for clients
This will require a new engine feature
This feature will work much like the server pause, except it will require an option determining how much each client
is allowed to save
UPDATE: This might not need to be done as an engine feature

Expand the color palette
The current stuff is for ground and most stuff
The new set of colors is for "foreground" stuff like tiles and people
