What about game orders being used a couple of turns after being distributed?

Don't allow the same command to be sent multiple times

Should camera speed modifiers effect zoom as well?

Zoom only at certain increments, does this fix the scaling graphics issues?

Add weather, just for looks right now except for wind speed below
Regions have wind speed, affected by weather
Tiles are animated, and animation speed is affected by wind speed of their region
Tile animations will have to be global, so the animation speed will be, too
It can be affected by all on-screen regions
Only animate on-screen tiles

What if one or both dimensions of the chunks on the minimap are 0?

Options for minimap size and position?

Move minimap updating into separate thread

Make sure that a person gathering actually looks in their current chunk first
It kind of seems like this isn't working right

Add controls (sliders, buttons, idk) for surplus percentages
The current constants for these will become the default values

Laptop has weird green crap on mouseover cursor

Add pause network command for clients

Expand the color palette
The current stuff is for ground and most stuff
The new set of colors is for "foreground" stuff like tiles and people

********
Maybe production of new people should cost food from the civ inventory
Every constant amount of time, if food is available, consume one and tick towards new person birth
This would need to be factored into wheat need calculation

Building should add to the unfinished  building's HP instead of insta finishing it
Multiple people could now build
Might not need flagging anymore
Could use flagging to affect build order priority
If a building is flagged, another person is less likely to work on it
This change would mean a need to change how tree need is calculated

Reconsider combat cooldown

I want simulated projectiles
