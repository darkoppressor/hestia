For military:
Progression of types of weapons/things
Swords, shields, horses, chariots, siege weapons, naval stuff, etc.
Also progression of each of these things
Improved swords, improved siege weapons, etc
Progression of formations
Progression of discipline?
Progression of tactics of some sort beyond formations?
Progression from citizen soldiers to professional soldiers/standing army

Actually choosing which of all available formations to use should be decided by the army AI
There could be "leadership training" or something to allow progressively better decision making here

Concept of holding some forces in reserve?
Would they just stand back a ways from the main battle area?

Some units should be able to attack (melee and ranged) while moving
This would allow more sensible cavalry and chariots

Concept of supplies/supply lines

Concepts of morale and suppression

Player should be able to choose what kind of equipment or units he wants in each army
Possibly only with a certain tech
Before the tech, the AI will choose what to equip the soldiers with
This could be related to the standing army tech mentioned above

Wood age makes no sense
Starting age should be stone age
Then ages progress to bronze and iron
Concept of "ages" might be unneeded
Instead, these techs are simply to allow new building materials to be gathered/used
Items and buildings can cost various combinations of resources to build
Wood is used to make some stone stuff, and maybe some later material stuff

Need to figure out what buildings are made from, and how can they be upgraded once a new material is learned?

World resources are:
Wheat for food
Trees for wood
Rocks for stone
Bronze mines (more accurately would this be copper mines?) for bronze
Iron mines for iron

Moving units should create dust clouds
Bigger units probably create bigger dust clouds
Dust clouds are only created in dirt/grass/stone/sand type terrains, and only when there is no rain or snow
Should sand storms create their own dust clouds? Maybe this could even replace their previous graphic
If there is fog of war, dust clouds can be seen even through it
There should probably be some way to create fake dust clouds to trick the enemy
There should also be some way to mask an army's dust clouds

Possible weapons:
Spear
Atlatl
Bow and arrow
Sword

Possible vehicles:
Horse
Chariot
Ballista
Trebuchet
Catapult

People can have various skills, each associated with a certain action
Not all actions need to have an associated skill
Skills are leveled up by performing their associated action
Skill levels should give small bonuses to doing the associated action
Skill level also heavily affects priority of AI actions
A person with a high skill level will be much more likely to perform that action over other actions
(at least other actions of equal priority)
Fighting could have a Combat skill
Being in an army could have a Soldiering skill
Leading an army (do generals exist?) could have a Leadership skill
Etc.

Technology could spread
Technology can be researched like normal
Once a tech has first been discovered by anyone, all other players begin getting progress towards it for free

Each player needs to have their own territory of their color
This spreads out in a rectangle or some simple shape from each city
The max size of a city's territory should be related to the distance allowed between cities, ensuring no territories ever overlap

No black shroud on the map
A fog of war is a good idea

Formations should be maintained while marching pretty strictly
(at least with best tech, can be more loosely enforced by AI with lower techs)
Related to this, formations should also be maintained during battle as much as possible
Ideally formations will simply cause the army to perform better in some way as a product of the simulation
If necessary, formations can be given combat buffs or something

Orders to armies (and maybe others?) take time to "arrive"
This communication lag is based on the army's (or other unit's) distance to the nearest city
Maybe other factors could affect communication lag: tech, and possibly enemies doing something

If you choose no god, maybe you should get some kind of benefit
Should all god powers be available always, or should you choose a specific god with specific powers?

Maybe a person can only equip one weapon or vehicle
If a ranged weapon is equipped, the person is a ranged unit
If a melee weapon is equipped, the person is a melee fighter
If a vehicle is equipped, the person is either a land or sea vehicle driver
Now, selecting an army's numbers and composition is one thing
You select the composition, which determines the numbers

Are ages really needed? I like the idea of techs unlocking each kind of thing per material
I.e., you unlock bronze swords, bronze bows (or whatever how fits this), etc separately
Buildings might all be covered by a single construction tech per material
How are upgrades of previous equipment or buildings handled when a new material tech is researched?
Maybe they can be upgraded as an action which requires some fraction of the material cost of that item (using the new material)
Buildings would always want to be upgraded, so would be queued up
Equipment might only be queued for upgrade in certain circumstances
If the desired number of an equipment type is available in the most up to date material, do nothing
If more are needed, prefer upgrading old equipment over building new equipment

People should not equip stuff unless part of an army

When trees and wheat grow, they should animate in some way, even if just starting small and scaling up to their size

Soldiers have hunger like normal, and this can be satiated via foraging
Soldiers also have a supply variable
This only applies to people in an army
When an army is formed, it has a gathering period where people stock up on equipment and food, and relocate to their army
When this happens they also have their supply maxed
Whenâ€‹ a supply caravan is formed, it carries simply supply, its own special resource
The actual resource cost in food, wood, etc for a supply caravan is determined by the army it is supplying
When a caravan reaches its army, it gives the army supply, which is a special resource for the army
When a soldier is hungry, he eats from the army if possible, and tries to forage otherwise
Foraging fills food as always but doesn't fill a soldier's supply
Eating from the army inventory fills food and supply for a soldier, and uses up a supply from the army inventory
Soldier supply shares the same max value and decreases at the same rate as hunger
Hunger affects a soldier just as any other person
Supply can have additional combat or even ai penalties

People cannot collide with each other, they ignore collision
Ditto for people with buildings
However, they should attempt not to collide with people or buildings
If they do collide with either, they receive a movement speed penalty
There are two penalties, one for people and one for buildings
A person can have either or both penalties, and they stack with each other
Might be a crazy idea, but people's speed change from these penalties could be slightly different per person
based on some characteristic of people that is somewhat unique
This would cause people walking over each other to naturally break apart, instead of staying on top of each other
while moving

Similarly to how supply caravans bring supplies to armies, maybe loot caravans should bring looted items from armies to
cities
When a soldier is not in combat, and their inventory is full, they might unload their looted items into the army inventory
The army inventory could hold unlimited loot items, but at some threshold amount of items, a loot caravan is generated
Determining what city to send the caravan to might work just like determining where the army's supplies come from
If an army is disbanded (manually or due to defeat), one final loot caravan should be generated

Depending on how I end up designing the world, I might be able to make the minimap pregenerate as part of game startup
and then never again
Cities and whatever else I want rendered over the minimap would be rendered in realtime

To do:
Finish buildings changes
Finish figuring out and implementing food resource, including farms and foraging
Finish design for world
Finish design for basic resources
Finish figuring out user controlled resource numbers
Finish design for basic city/buildings
Finish design for people
At this point, implement any changes
This might include mountains and water changes,
As well as pathfinding
Design armies and supply lines
Implement armies and supply lines
This will include logistics and tactical stuff
A lot of the tactical stuff will be restricted to or affected by techs, which haven't been designed yet
